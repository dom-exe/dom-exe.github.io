				<h5>
					Intake
				</h5>
				<p>
					An intake system is a crucial part of a car's engine. 
					It is responsible for providing the engine with the air it needs to run. 
					An intake system can be upgraded to provide the engine with more air,
					which can result in more power. <br>
					It also comes with the added benefit of a better sound. Listen to the 
					sound clip below for an example of an upgraded intake system. <br>

				<h5>
					Exhaust
				</h5>
				<p>
					An exhaust system is another crucial part of a car's engine. 
					It is responsible for removing the gases produced by the engine. 
					An exhaust system can be upgraded to provide the engine with better 
					performance. <br>
					It also comes with the added benefit of a better sound. Listen to the 
					sound clip below for an example of an upgraded exhaust system. One of 
					these are simply a replacement backbox, the other sports a fully custom 
					exhaust. <br>

			<h4>
				Forced Induction
			</h4>				

			<p>
				Forced induction is a method of increasing the power output of an engine. 
				It involves compressing the air that enters the engine, which results in 
				more air being forced into the engine. This can result in more power. <br>
				There are two main types of forced induction: turbochargers and superchargers. 
				Both of these methods can be used to increase the power output of an engine. <br>
				Click the buttons below to see more information about each option.

					Supercharger
			</button>
			
			<div id="turbo" class="hidden-text">
				<h5>
					Turbocharger
				</h5>
				<p>
					A turbocharger is a turbine spun by exhaust gases, which in turn sucks
					in more air into the intake. Using exhaust gases means there is no 
					drag on the engine, but their is turbo lag on larger platforms. <br>

			<div id="supercharger" class="hidden-text">
				<h5>
					Supercharger
				</h5>
				<p>
					A supercharger is a belt-driven compressor that forces more air into 
					the engine. This means there is no lag, but there is a parasitic loss 
					on the engine. <br>
